    Pup Party application with example tests
  </h1>
</div>

As referenced in ["A practical guide to testing Clerk Next.js applications,"](https://clerk-git-testing-post.clerkstage.dev/blog/testing-clerk-nextjs#conclusion) this repo allows you to follow along with adding tests for our sample application, Pup Party. If you'd like to see the finished branch, including tests, you can find that [here](https://github.com/lilybarrett/pup-party/tree/finished). 

Pup Party was originally built on top of Clerk's Next.js (App Router) template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/clerk/nextjs-auth-starter-template). 

## Running the app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lilybarrett/pup-party.git
```

To run the example locally, you need to:

1. Sign up for a Clerk account at [https://clerk.com](https://go.clerk.com/31bREJU).
2. Go to the [Clerk dashboard](https://go.clerk.com/4I5LXFj) and create an application.
3. Set the required Clerk environment variables as shown in [the example `env` file](https://github.com/lilybarrett/pup-party/blob/main/.env.example).
4. Go to "Organization Settings" in your sidebar and enable Organizations
5. Run `npm install` the required dependencies.
6. Run `npm run dev` to launch the development server. You should be able to access the application locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
